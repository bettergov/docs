# BGA web development guide

The goal of this style guide is to pack as many front-end decisions and components into a single reference. It is a living document, inspired by style guides developed and shared by the [Texas Tribune](http://cookbook.latimes.com/), the [LA Times](http://cookbook.latimes.com/) and [POLITICO](https://politico.gitbooks.io/politico-newsroom-developer-guide/).

The ultimate goals here are:

1. Every piece of BGA web content pulls from a common set of styles.
2. Those styles are modular and flexible, following [Inverted Triangle CSS \(ITCSS\)](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) conventions.
3. Our processes for developing our products aren't a mystery!
