# For developers

## Hosting

Our site is hosted on [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/quickstart/). From a development perspective, this gives us full access to our site's codebase and allows us to easily add collaborators from supporting organizations.

The most beneficial advantages of Pantheon involve versioning and workflows, including:

* Separate Dev, Test and Live environments which you can easily sync code, data and files between
* On-server development via SFTP Connection Mode
* Git version control
* Multidev environments â€” branches that live on their own urls
* [Terminus](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/), a command line interface for interacting with Pantheon

To get the lay of the Pantheon land, I recommend reading through their [Quick Start guide](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/quickstart/). Here's their [full documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/).

We also keep a version of our website on GitHub at [git@github.com:bettergov/bettergov.org.git](https://github.com/bettergov/bettergov.org). Be sure to follow the steps in [Syncing with GitHub](for-developers.md#syncing-with-github) to keep this version in sync with Pantheon.

## Developing locally

Lando lets us easily spin up a local development environment. They have a configuration specifically for syncing with Pantheon.

### Requirements

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) from `Docker.dmg`from the Docker site
2. Ensure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed and up-to-date
3. Install [Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando) using Homebrew: `brew install cask lando`

### Getting started

1. Create an empty directory
2. `cd` into the new directory
3. Run `lando init pantheon`. You should be able to select your Pantheon identity and site.
4. From Pantheon, [create a machine token](https://pantheon.io/docs/machine-tokens/). At the end, run the following to add the token to lando: `lando terminus auth:login --machine-token=<machine-token>`
5. Run `lando start`. This spins up the local app server.
6. Run `lando pull`. You will be able to pull code, database and files from a Pantheon environment. 

### More about lando pull

Generally speaking, we use `lando pull` for the initial build.

For image syncing, rsync them: `lando pull --rsync`

More examples, from Lando's docs:

```bash
# Pull the latest code, database and files
# This will pull the environment associated with your currently checked out git branch
lando pull

# Skip a code merge
lando pull --code=none

# Pull only the database from the test environment
lando pull --database=test --files=none

# Pull only the files
lando pull --database=none

# Pull only the latest files without grabbing a files backup
lando pull --database=none --rsync
```

### Pushing local changes

We use`lando push`to push up any changes to code, database and files made locally.

Lando only pushes up code by default.

```bash
# Push the local code
# This will push to the environment associated with your currently checked out git branch
lando push

# Push only the database and code
lando push --files=none

 # Push only the files and code
 lando push --database=none 
```

### Shutting down lando

```bash
# Force shutdown all Docker containers
docker container kill $(docker container ls -a -q)

# Remove all Docker containers
docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -q)

# Remove all Docker images
docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)
```

## Syncing with GitHub

We also keep a version of our website on GitHub at [git@github.com:bettergov/bettergov.org.git](https://github.com/bettergov/bettergov.org).

The simplest way to keep this version in sync with Pantheon is to edit`.git/config`and add GitHub to the origin branch.

```text
[remote "origin"]
    url = ssh://codeserver.dev.<SITE_UUID>@codeserver.dev.<SITE_UUID>.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git
    url = git@github.com:bettergov/bettergov.org.git
```
