# For editors

## Adding an article

1. Log in at [https://www.bettergov.org/user](https://www.bettergov.org/user)
2. To create an article, click Add Content \(top left of screen\) &gt; Article. Or go the ['Add Article' form](https://www.bettergov.org/node/add/article) directly.
3. Fill out the following fields at bare minimum:
   * Title
   * Author\(s\)
   * Article image
   * Lead image caption
   * Type
   * Issue\(s\)
   * Teaser \(dek\)
   * Body \(see section 'Authoring the body'\)

## Scheduling an article

You can either save your article as a draft \(unpublished\) or schedule it to publish.

#### Saving as draft

To save the article as a draft indefinitely, do **not** fill out the publish time. Doing so will schedule the post to publish in the future. Once done editing, simply hit save as draft.

#### Publishing

To publish the article now or in the future, set the publish time. Use the calendar picker for the date. The time is 24 hour format \(so 15:00 for 3pm\). Finally hit publish.

## Authoring the body

Below the body textarea, where you can paste and edit text, there is a dropdown menu labled **Text format**. There are two options in the dropdown that we want to focus on: Full HTML and Clean paste.

When copying from Word, or Google Docs, or emails, etc. we want to strip as much extra formatting and whitespace as possible. We achieve this through the **Clean paste** text format.

Using it is simple:

1. Select **Clean paste** from the text format dropdown.
2. Copy and paste your article into the textarea.
3. You should get an alert in your browser that says: "Cleaned on paste."
4. That's it! You can switch the dropdown back to **Full HTML** to finish editing the article.

Sometimes the clean paste task doesn't strip all of the whitespace the first iteration. To fix, simply repeat the clean paste process with the once-cleaned text.
{% endhint %}
